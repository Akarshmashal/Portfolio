        By looking at the photos and videos, one can instantly and easily find and identify the
        objec they are interested in. Passing this intelligence to a computer is nothing more than recognizing
        an object, that is, identifying an object.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

        Object detection has been found to be used in a variety
        of areas such as video surveillance, image retrieval systems, self-driving cars, and many others.
        There are many algorithms that can be used to detect objects, but for now we will focus on the
        YOLO V3 algorithm. YOLO is an abbreviation for "You Only Look Once".
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The YOLO model
        is very accurate and can recognize objects that reside in the frame.To detect an object, these systems take
        a
        classifier for that object and evaluate it at various locations and scales in an exceedingly very
        test image. Systems like deformable parts models use a window approach where the classifier
        is run at evenly spaced locations over the entire image.
        More recent approaches like R-CNN use region proposal methods to first generate
        potential bounding boxes during a picture then run a classifier on these proposed boxes.

        <p>
          Apartment Visitor Management system is a web-based technology that will revolutionize the
          way your society manages visitors. Visitor Management system is more important to security
          guards or
          security society.

          This web application provides a way to effectively control record & track society visitor
          traffic.
          In AVMS we use PHP and MySQL database. This is the project which keeps records of visitors who
          visited in
          the Society. </p>

          <strong>Visitors:</strong> In this section, admin adds new visitors by filling their information
          in add visitors
          sections
          and also view and manage visitor’s records. Admin also put visitors out time in the manage
          records section.

          <strong>Reports: </strong> In this section admin can generate visitor’s reports between two
          dates.
          Admin can also update his profile, change password and recover password.
